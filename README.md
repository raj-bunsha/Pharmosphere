## Getting Started

Welcome to Pharmosphere. An application for managing a pharmacy. This application is built using Java and mysql.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies
- 'sql': the folder to maintain sql files

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.
